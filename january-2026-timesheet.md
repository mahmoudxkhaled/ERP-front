# January 2026 Timesheet

**Groups:** Tasks are split into **Personal Groups** (user-level groups) and **Entity Groups** (account groups within an entity/company).

**Notifications:** Tasks are split into **Notification Management** (send, categories, types, admin), **Notification Inbox** (inbox list and viewing notifications), and **Top Notification** (bell, unread count, and quick access in the top bar).

**Design & planning:** Design is done first; 2–3 hours in the middle of each week are allocated for planning and design before implementation.
