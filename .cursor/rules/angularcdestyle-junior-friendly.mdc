When writing Angular code, always prioritize clarity and simplicity.

Rules to follow:

Write clean, readable code

Use clear and meaningful variable, method, and component names

Avoid abbreviations and clever tricks

Keep it simple

Do NOT use advanced or complex Angular patterns

Avoid over-engineering

Prefer basic Angular features (components, services, simple forms)

Junior-friendly

Code must be easy for a junior developer to understand

If logic is not obvious, add a short comment explaining it

Avoid RxJS complexity (no advanced operators unless absolutely necessary)

Small and focused

Keep components small and focused on one responsibility

Methods should be short and do only one thing

No unnecessary abstractions

Do not introduce patterns, helpers, or utilities unless they are clearly needed

Avoid advanced architecture concepts

Simple Angular syntax

Prefer template-driven or basic reactive forms

Use straightforward HTML templates

Avoid complex directives and pipes unless required

Consistency

Follow standard Angular structure and naming conventions

Use consistent formatting

Goal:

Any junior Angular developer should be able to read and understand the code without confusion.
